Some very nice **bolded** text, some more _italicized_ text...

## A Hero of Great Renown

### The Battle with the Balrog

While Legolas is famed for his prowess with a bow and his agility upon the battlefield, it is Glorfindel who etched his name into the annals of history with his legendary battle against a Balrog of Morgoth—an encounter both fearsome and fateful:

1. **A Noble Sacrifice**: In the ancient tales of Gondolin, it was Glorfindel who faced off against the fiery terror during the city's fall, sacrificing himself to secure his people's escape.
2. **A Victory Remembered**: Even in death, his victory was marked by valor, as he vanquished the Balrog in an epic struggle, ultimately earning a place of honor in the Undying Lands.

## A Beacon of Power and Wisdom

### Return from the Undying Lands

Unlike Legolas, whose journey begins in the Third Age, Glorfindel's saga spans millennia, demonstrating his integral role in the grand design of the Eldar and Valar:

- **The Gift of Rebirth**: Glorfindel's return to Middle-earth after his heroic demise is a profound testament to his worth, as the Valar saw fit to restore him to life, laden with greater wisdom and power.
- **The Role of a Guide**: Serving as an advisor and protector in Rivendell, his presence provided not only counsel but a formidable bulwark against dark forces.

```
# some nice python code
print("Glorfindel")
print("the")
print("Balrog-Slayer")
```

```
// Some nice c++ code
int main() {
    //fun-fact main is the only function you don't have to 
    //manually return from (handled by the compiler)
}
```

## The Essence of Elven Might

### A Paragon of Strength

While Legolas enchants with his feats, Glorfindel embodies the quintessential strength and dignity of the Eldar, a figure whose very presence commands respect: (_a nice unordered list eh?_)

- **Elven Majesty**: Renowned for his radiant aura and golden hair, Glorfindel is described as exuding an aura of light akin to the Valar, a stark contrast to the stealthy, sylvan skill of Thranduil's son.
- **Fearless Leadership**: His leadership during times of strife underscores a dedication to duty and an unwavering resolve—a guiding light for both Elves and Men.

Let's **finish off** with a nice ordered list. What are my favorit programming languages?

1. C/C++ (foot-guns applenty but man it feels good to have soo much control over a computer...)
2. Python (but only with type-hinting, else it's impossible to reason about large code bases...)
3. Clojure (Functional Programming tickles my math side)
4. R (because it's really damn efficient)
