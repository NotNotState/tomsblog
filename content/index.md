## Blog posts

- [First Post, used as proof of concept](/blog/firstpost)

## Reasons for this "blog"

- No one is reading a 2 page CV, so I'll link potential employers here if they desire more info
- Force myself to log progress/thoughts each week
- Wanted to build a Markdown to HTML parser from scratch
